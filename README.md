## Learning Goals:
At the time of this project, I am a student at Turing School of Software Engineering in the front end development program, in mod 2. This is a project that I did in my own time, in order to prepare for our lesson on learning React in mod 3. This project was a way for me to practice and apply concepts that I learned such as writing components, organizing files in a structure, using hooks, setting state, and fetching data from an API with React.
